Limitations/Assumptions:
1. No unit testing done
2. Assumes that the Input files are robust, properly formatted, and named properly
3. The check to see if the item is exempt or not is essentially hard coded.. if we have
   more input files, potentially an exempt item might not be on the item exempt list..
4. Functionality to check if the item is exempt is done in the main method
5. When rounding the sales tax to 2 decimal places, we only preserve accuracy up to 4 decimal places

Justifications:
1. Extensive blackbox testing done, as well as testing by using print statements and comparing
   the values to calculations done through paper
2. This project is modifiable and given more use cases as well as more examples of the Input file,
   we can make the file parser more robust
3. Well I mean it's hardcoded by adding the items to a hashMap... so there is room for expandability
   there, i.e we can add more items to the hashmap
4. Since a hashmap itself is an object.. I see no real need to define a new object with a 
   hashMap container within the class?
5. 4 decimal places is decently accurate
