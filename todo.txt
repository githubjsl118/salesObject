TODO:

/* so the program now compiles and runs, so now we need to sepearate the outputs based on which input file
that the data is from.  we furthermore have to verify that the calculations for the tax is correct,
namely that we do not calculate tax from those items that are exempt from taxation
*/
Above has been completed


We now have to create a data structure that contains the list of items that are exempt from 
being taxed.  We have to determine which class and where exactly to instantiate this 
data structure

Essentially we have two options for where we want to put the hashmap

the first option would be in the salesobject class

the second option would be in the totalsales class


might be better to insert it into the salesobject class and make a new private variable
that will notify it the item is tax exempt or not.  we can set this variable by comparing
the word to the words in the dictionary set by the hashtable


potentially we can put the instantiation of the hashtable dictionary in the main method
of the salesobject class




in the totalsales class we are now required to fix the calculate tax and the print
methods to correctly reflect those items that are tax exempt

in the salesobject file, we have to run the names and see if there is a match in the
hashtable

we should be able to run unit tests afterwards

we are done modifying the salesobject class now
